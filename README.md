# GLC-Multiprotocol
A project where we are exploring methods for integrating multiple aerial survey data sets observing waterbirds in the Great Lakes. We modeled the abundance and distribution of six waterbird taxonomic groups using a multi-protocol distance sampling approach. This repository includes a JAGS model file and the code to run the file in R with the appropriate data and initial values for each of the six taxa. Additionally, we've included an R script that processes waterbird observation data that was given to the modeling team.

Taxa included:

Long-tailed Duck
Gulls
Goldeneyes
Loons
Mergansers
Scaup
