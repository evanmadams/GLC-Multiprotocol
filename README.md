# GLC-Multiprotocol
A project where we are exploring methods for integrating multiple aerial survey data sets observing waterbirds in the Great Lakes. We modeled the abundance and distribution of 7 waterbird taxonomic groups using a multi-protocol distance sampling approach. This repository includes a JAGS model file and the code to run the file in R with the appropriate data and initial values for each of the seven taxa. Additionally, we've included an R script that processes waterbird observation data that was given to the modeling team.
